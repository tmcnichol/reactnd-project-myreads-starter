# MyReads Project

This is a react application built for keeping track of book reading activity. The user can choose from a selection of books from the searc hpage and place books on 3 main shelves located on the homepage: Currently Reading, Want To Read, and Read. I coded the react portions of this project based on the [create-react-app](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter.git) starter template for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course.


## How it Works

After cloning or forking this repository:

* cd (change directory) into the project folder with `cd reactnd-project-myreads-starter`
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

After taking these steps in order, the project will launch on localhost:3000 and enable you to start organizing your books.

    ├── index.css # Global styles. You probably won't need to change anything here.
    └── index.js # You should not need to modify this file. It is used for DOM rendering only.
```

Remember that good React design practice is to create new JS files for each component and use import/require statements to include them where they are needed.

## Backend Server

This project contains a backend server to enable basic functionality. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods that were used to perform necessary operations on the backend:

* [`getAll`](#getall)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`search`](#search)

### `getAll`

Method Signature:

```js
getAll()
```

* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
* This collection represents the books currently in the bookshelves in your app.

### `update`

Method Signature:

```js
update(book, shelf)
```

* book: `<Object>` containing at minimum an `id` attribute
* shelf: `<String>` contains one of ["wantToRead", "currentlyReading", "read"]  
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing the response data of the POST request

### `search`

Method Signature:

```js
search(query)
```

* query: `<String>`
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of a maximum of 20 book objects.
* These books do not know which shelf they are on. They are raw results only. You'll need to make sure that books have the correct state while on the search page.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Contributing

This repository is in the process of being reviewed for completion credit as part of the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. Therefore, I most likely will not accept pull requests until I have received instructor feedback and completed this project.
